Kicking off project

### Goalt Today

First attempt to create dataset of pairs of tikz code + images

### Ideas

- Scrape online examples of code and images
- Generate code using LLM's and latex compiled them
- Collect pairs by hand
- Augment the compiled images using a diffusion model to make them look like drawn

### Learned Lessons

- [https://texample.net/tikz/examples](https://texample.net/tikz/examples) can provide examples
- I can use Selenium to access page and save images
- The code section in this website uses [ACE](https://ace.c9.io/)
- Tikz can use commands that were predifined so you can't actually just scrappe the block \begin{tikzpicture}
- I could not find any latex compiler in python, I found the library pnglatex but no I had to install a pdflatex which in windows seemed not so straight forward so I stopped there
